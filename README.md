### Hi, I'm Shaiyan ðŸ‘‹
About me:
I'm a full-stack web dev specializing in HTML/CSS, React, JavaScript, and SQL. I LOVE learning! 
I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects! 
When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, drawing, writing, crocheting, sewing, petting cats, or playing guitar.
