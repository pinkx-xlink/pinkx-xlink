### Hi, I'm Shaiyan ðŸ‘‹
Here's some info about me:
I'm a junior fullstack web dev specializing in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 
I'm currently learning SQL (using Snowflake database) and becoming more proficient with Power BI Dashboards.
I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects! 
In search of an entry level web development role where I'll be able to apply my current skillset while gaining hands-on experience as part of a team.
